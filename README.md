# CV-Screening-and-Candidate-Filtering-System

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project is a resume (CV) screening and candidate filtering platform that automates the tedious first stage of recruitment. It enables HR teams to upload job descriptions and large batches of candidate CVs, then automatically extracts key information, matches candidates against role requirements, and provides a quantitative score along with a preliminary Accept / Review / Reject decision.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Automate resume screening: Reduce manual effort for recruiters by parsing and structuring information from diverse CV formats.
- Standardize candidate evaluation: Use a transparent, deterministic scoring model to ensure fairness and consistency.
- Scale with volume: Handle batch uploads (50+ CVs at a time) reliably.
- Support HR decision-making: Provide explainable results with clear breakdown of matched vs. missing skills.
